        <h2>5. Payments and Billing</h2>
        <h2>Acceptable Payment Methods</h2>

        <p>5.1 {{appName}} accepts major credit cards, debit cards, and Paypal payments. Subscribers who choose to pay with PayPal will be strictly limited to a single {{appName}} Account per PayPal account. Virtual credit cards and gift cards typically will not be accepted. Other forms of payment may be arranged by contacting {{appName}} at contact@{{appDomain}}. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for paid Services are deemed part of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>5.2 We use third-party payment processors (the “Payment Processors”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the paid Services. The processing of payments may be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processors in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processors. By choosing to use paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processors, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processors, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment</p>

        <h2>Billing and Terms</h2>
        <p>5.3 The term of this Agreement shall be monthly, to commence on the date that the Subscriber signs up electronically for the Services by creating an Account with an email address. All invoices are denominated, and Subscriber must pay, in U.S. Dollars. Subscribers are typically billed monthly on or about the first day of each month, with payment due no later than ten (10) days past the invoice date. On rare occasions, a Subscriber may be billed an amount up to the Subscriber's current balance in an effort to verify the authenticity of the Subscriber's account information. This process ensures that Subscribers without a payment history are not subjected to additional scrutiny. Subscribers are entirely responsible for the payment of all taxes. For specific pricing policies, please refer to <a href="{{appUrl}}pricing">{{appUrl}}pricing</a>. Monthly fees and renewal fees will be billed at the rate agreed to at purchase. You may cancel the Services at any time by logging into your Control Panel at <a href="{{appUrl}}/support/tickets">{{appUrl}}/support/tickets</a>. At cancellation, your Account will be inactivated and you will no longer be able to log into our site and/or have any access to the Services. Except in the case of subscription commitments you have agreed to, which shall be <strong>nonrefundable</strong>, as permitted by law, if you cancel, you agree that fees for the first month of Services and any start-up costs associated with setting up your Account (“Start-up Costs”) shall be <strong>nonrefundable</strong>, as permitted by law. With the exception of any subscription commitments agreed by you, if you paid fees in advance for any period longer than one month, then you may, with the exception of fees for the first month of Services and any Start-up Costs, obtain a refund on a pro rata basis for the period remaining after you cancel. </p>

        <p>5.4 Some of the paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO <a href="{{appUrl}}/user_payment_profiles">{{appUrl}}/user_payment_profiles</a>.</p>
        <p>5.5 YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSORS IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT <a href="{{appUrl}}/settings">{{appUrl}}/settings</a>. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>

        <h2>Arrearages</h2>
        <p>5.6 Payments not made within ten (10) days of invoicing will be deemed in arrears. For accounts in arrears, if any amount is more than ten (10) days overdue, without the requirement of providing notice of such arrears, {{appName}} may suspend service to such account and bring legal action to collect the full amount due, including any attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>

        <h2>Suspension for Nonpayment</h2>
        <p>5.7 If a Subscriber is past due on their balance, {{appName}} may send up to three (3) email notifications within a fifteen (15) day period before suspending the Subscriber's account. Servers will be temporarily powered off during the suspension period. {{appName}} reserves the right to delete the Subscriber's suspended machines after the final termination notice.</p>

        <h2>15. Mandatory Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>15.1	In the interest of resolving disputes between you and {{appName}} in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and {{appName}} agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND {{appName}} ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  This Section 15 will not apply to disputes arising under the U.S.-EU/U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor frameworks, which shall instead be administered under the rules for the resolution of disputes arising under the Safe Harbor frameworks specified in the {{appName}} Safe Harbor filing with the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p>
        <p>15.2	Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. </p>
        <p>15.3	Any arbitration between you and {{appName}} will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting {{appName}}.</p>
        <p>15.4	A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). {{appName}}'s address for Notice is: {{appName}}., 101 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10013. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or {{appName}} may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or {{appName}} must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, {{appName}} will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by {{appName}} in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.</p>
        <p>15.5	If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, {{appName}} will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse {{appName}} for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
        <p>15.6	YOU AND {{appName}} AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and {{appName}} agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
        <p>15.7	If {{appName}} makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to {{appName}}'s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to {{appName}}'s address for Notice, in which case your account with {{appName}} will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
        <p>15.8	If Section 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>

        <p>16.5 This Agreement, including all related agreements and policies incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement between the parties relating to the Services. A valid waiver hereunder shall not be interpreted to be a waiver of that obligation in the future or any other obligation under this Agreement. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives. If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or held to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected such that this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such unenforceable provision had never constituted a part hereof. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute the same instrument. This Agreement may be signed electronically or, as set out above, your access and use of the Services will manifest your consent to this Agreement. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. All references to “laws,” “rules,” or “regulations” references any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations, whether domestic or foreign. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Service, all notices under these Terms of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Electronic notices should be sent to <a href="mailto:legal@{{appDomain}}">legal@{{appDomain}}</a>.</p>
